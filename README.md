**Student Grade Summary Program - Readme**

**How to Run the Program:**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.

3. Run the program using the appropriate Python command:

   - For Linux or macOS users:
     ```
     python3 main.py
     ```

   - For Windows users:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

4. The program will prompt you for the input and output file names.

5. **Input File:** When you see the message 'Enter the input file name:', type in the name of the input file that contains the data of the students. For example, you can use 'input.txt' as the input file.

6. **Output File:** After entering the input file name, the program will prompt you with 'Enter the output file name:'. Here, type the name of the file where you want the program to save the output data. For better organization, we recommend using 'output.txt' as the output file name.

7. Press the Enter key after typing the file names.

8. The program will execute and process the student data from the input file, calculate the final averages, and generate a summary report in the specified output file.

9. After completion, you will find the summary report in the output file you specified ('output.txt').

**Note:** Make sure that the input file ('input.txt') exists in the same directory as the program file ('main.py') before running the program. Additionally, ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
